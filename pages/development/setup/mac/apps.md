# Apps / Utilities

Some Mac apps / utilities I use to support my productivity / usage with Mac

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/): move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas, really helpful for users who are familiar with Windows window snap feature.
- [MonitorControl](https://monitorcontrol.app/): control your display's brightness & volume on your Mac as if it was a native Apple Display.
- [KeyCastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr): open-source keystroke visualizer (for demo / streaming purpose)
- [Termius](https://www.termius.com/)
- [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev/): a blazingly fast, rust-based terminal reimagined from the ground up to work like a modern app. Been my favorite terminal since starting to use mac and never find other alternatives since then.
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Node version manager (considering to switch to `fnm` or `volta`)
